[MAJOR]
1. Find out if the signals system for reloading assets is: 1) compatible with gunicorn workers, 2) is worth keeping
TRY KILLING IT AND SEE IF IT COMES BACK UP (maybe better to kill with an error)

2. RSS_FINDER - if the find endpoint is activated but the url is not recognised, put out an error message that confirms this

3. Add option to have more (all?) errors returned as JSON.

4. Update server-side code to check Origin header of requests, match it against a list of origins and return (if appropriate) an access-control-allow-origin header.

[MINOR]
1. Non-streamed functions return an Obj of {Code, Headers, Body}, streamed ones return {Code, Headers, data}. Create more consistency.
